# StudentIntervention
Machine Learning Nanodegree at Udacity - Student Intervention

The goal of this project was to build a model to predict which students might need intervention before they fail to graduate.

Tools and techniques used in this project include:

* data exploration through summary statistics and data visualization
* defining a performance metric (coefficient of determination for this project)
* splitting data into train & test sets, shuffling, and cross-validation


* pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib libraries for Python
* converting categorical features to dummy variables using pandas get_dummies function
* splitting data into train & test sets, shuffling, and cross-validation
* evaluating pros & cons of different supervised machine learning models and choosing appropriate models for this application
* metrics for unbalanced classes, including precision, recall, and F1 score


* learning curves & complexity curves to analyze model performance
* bias/variance tradeoff 
* sklearn implementation of a decision-tree model
* use of gridsearch for hyperparameter tuning and optimization
* sensitivity analysis
* real-life applicability
